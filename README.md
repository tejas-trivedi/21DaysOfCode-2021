UPES ACM & ACM-W Student Chapters are back with "21DaysOfCode", an initiative to develop strong problem-solving skills and inculcate a consistent coding habit among our fellow members. Choose any Programming Language you want to work with and channelize the coder in you.

## Guidelines

As all of you begin your coding journey with us, we welcome you and hope you adhere to the following guidelines for 21DaysOfCode :

- **Make sure you are regular with your commits.** This will help keep a track of your progress, and will help us better understand your coding journey as well.
- **Document your process.** This will help you understand your code better and help any third person who views your code, understand it as well. So do add proper comments describing what a particular function does. If you have solved any problem from any of the coding platform, then do attach it's link in the README.md
- **Add a proper commit message.** Make sure that your commit message properly describes what problem you have solved and what technique/algorithm was used to solve it. Along with this use a proper title while generating a Pull Request.
- **Ask your doubts.** The Whatsapp group is for the sole purpose of having all of us engage with each other and discuss our doubts as we go along on our competitive programming journey.
- Lastly, **Don't be afraid to start.** Coding can be very easy if you are consistent and committed to it. You will get errors, which you will learn over time how to solve. Competitive programming can be simple, if you are regular with it.

## Pre-requisites

- **Markdown:** To update the README.md file for each problem you solve. No need to learn markdown, you can always refer to the online markdown editor.
- **Basic Git:** Basic knowledge of Git and it's workflow is must. If you are not comfortable, feel free to ask.
